Morphological development 
=========================

The "morphological development" `repository <https://github.com/GII/morphological_development>`_ is dedicated to present the work in the field carried out by the researchers and 
collaborators of the `Integrated Group for Engineering Research <http://www.gii.udc.es/?id=3>`_.
 
The work in the field performed on the research group focuses on understanding the mechanisms behind why morphological development 
may or may not influence learning, to improve the learning ability and environmental adaptation of the robots. 

With this in mind, this repository addresses both different strategies of morphological development (growth, range of motion variation, 
freezeng and freeing degrees of freedom) and several morphologies (quadrupeds, hexapods, and octopods). Morphological development 
strategies and morphologies can be extended with the development of future work.
