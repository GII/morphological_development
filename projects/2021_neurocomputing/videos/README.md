# Videos

This folder includes a series of videos showing the different gaits of the best individuals obtained for each morphology and type of experiment.

The file nomenclature refers to the morphology, "Quadruped" (with several degrees of freedom), "Hexapod", "Octopod", and the type of experiment, "NoDev" (No Development) and "Growth"

Furthermore, the folder "fitness_landscapes" refers to the section "7. Discussion" of the article. In it, there are two videos that shows the roughness of the fitness landcape for the adult morphology of the quadruped with 8 DOF, where a small change in the parameter P1 (changing it form 60 to 59 remaining the P2 paramenter fixed in 61) leads to a very different result in the travelled distance.
