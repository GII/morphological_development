# Videos

This folder includes a series of videos showing the different gaits of the best individuals obtained for each morphology and type of experiment.

The file nomenclature refers to the morphology, "Quadruped" (with several degrees of freedom), "Hexapod", "Octopod", and the type of experiment, "NoDev" (No Development) and "Growth"

Furthermore, the folder "fitness_landscapes" refers to the section "6. Fitness landscape representation" of the article. In the folder, there are two videos that show how the small change in the parameter P1 displayed in the figure 10 and comented in the article (changing it form 60 to 59 remaining the P2 paramenter fixed in 61) leads to a very different result in the travelled distance.
