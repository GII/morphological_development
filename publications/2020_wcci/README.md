This folder presents the sorce code of the learning experiments presented in the article titled:
"An Experiment in Morphological Development for Learning ANN Based Controllers" [Link](https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/85513775/2020_experiment_MD_WCCI_preprint_version.pdf) (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206749)

Presented in: "2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55I6lNyok4&t=47s)

The folder contains:

- Sorce code: Folder that contains the source code for the different experiments. It contais:
    1. The source code of the learning process for the 8DOF, for the no development, growth and range of motion experiments.
    2. The source code to run the best individual obtained for each morphology and type of experiment (no development and growth)
- videos: Videos that show the best gait for each morpholoy and type of experiment.
- vrep_scenes: VREP scenes for each morpholoy.
