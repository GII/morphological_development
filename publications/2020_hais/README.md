# 2020 HAIS

This folder presents the sorce code of the learning experiments presented in the article titled:
"Some Experiments on the Influence of Problem Hardness in Morphological Development Based Learning of Neural Controllers" [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05817) (DOI https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61705-9_30 )

Presented in: "2020 Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems (HAIS)" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVc_YNrfFwM&t=315s)

The folder contains:

- sorce code: Folder that contains the source code for the different experiments. It contais:
    1. The source code of the learning process for the 8DOF, quadruped, the hexapod and octopod for the no development and growth experiment.
    2. The source code to run the best individual obtained for each morphology and type of experiment (no development and growth)
- videos: Videos that show the best gait for each morpholoy and type of experiment.
- vrep_scenes: VREP scenes for each morpholoy.
