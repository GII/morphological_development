# Software

This section of the repository is dedicated to describe the different Software resources used to carry out the experiments. Due to the size of the different software and libraries, and their avaliability online, only links to them would be provided.

For simplicity, the source code presented in this repository has been tested and run under a more actualized versions of the software. That is, the user can avoid to search or install the specific versions of the software where the experiments have been performed. However, slight differences in the results and robotics behaviors may be encountered.

That is, the source code presented in this project can run on:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Python 3.8
- CoppeliaSim v4.1

Again, differences in the results can be obtained respect to the experimental configuration in which the experiments were performed.

The experimental configuration where experiments were carried out is the following one:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (a Singularity 3.7.3 image of it is provided in the following link:https://udcgal-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/martin_naya_udc_es/ERnt7lYSIjhEoRvhmitLmJ8BtAB_i9ndq4Z6MVkZ1KX-hA?e=xpqbcB)
- Python 2.7.15
- VREP v3.6.2 (https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/previousVersions)

And the NEAT algorithm library, which is independent of the OS, python version and simulator:
