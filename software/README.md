# Software

This section of the repository is dedicated to describe the different Software resources used to carry out the experiments. Due to the size of the different software and libraries, and their avaliability online, only links to them would be provided.

Although the source code presented in this repository can run under a more actualized versions of them, offering slight differences in the results, the specific version of each software where the experiments were performed will be described. 

For example, the source code presented in this project can run on:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Python 3.8
- CoppeliaSim v4.1

However, again, differences in the results can be obtained respect to the experimental configuration in which the experiments were performed.

The experimentl configuration is the following one:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (a Singularity 3.7.3 image of it is provided in the following link:https://udcgal-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/martin_naya_udc_es/ERnt7lYSIjhEoRvhmitLmJ8BtAB_i9ndq4Z6MVkZ1KX-hA?e=xpqbcB)
